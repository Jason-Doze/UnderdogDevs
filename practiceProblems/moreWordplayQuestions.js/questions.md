More Wordplay questions
The sections after this section (“NBA Finals”, “Top Movies”, “Billboard Top 100”) are focused on using bigger datasets to practice breaking down and solving larger problems, including making choices about what data structures to use, coming up with an algorithm to implement, and writing functions to help organize your implementation.

Before you move on to those sections, we recommend confirming that you are comfortable independently breaking down, implementing, and debugging the questions below. If you aren’t, work with your mentor on more Wordplay, Countries, and Baby Names-sized questions until you are consistently able to solve them independently.


Revisiting for loops, if conditions, and using lists as storage
<!-- What are all of the words that both start with a “TH” and end with a “TH”?

What are all of the words that have only “U”s for vowels?

What are all of the words that have only “E”s for vowels and are at least 15 letters long?

What are all of the words that start with “PRO”, end in “ING”, and are exactly 11 letters long?

What are the shortest words that start with “PRO” and end in “ING”? Make sure your solution can handle ties. -->

<!-- What are all of the words that can be made from only the letters in “RSTLNE”? Not all of those letters need to be used, and letters can be repeated. -->

What is the longest word that can be made from only the letters in “RSTLNE”? Not all of those letters need to be used, and letters can be repeated. Make sure your solution can handle ties.

What are all of the words that can be made without the letters in “AEIOSHRTN” (in other words, without the most common letters)? Not all of those letters need to be used, and letters can be repeated.

What is the longest word that can be made without the letters in “AEIOSHRTN” (in other words, without the most common letters)? Not all of those letters need to be used, and letters can be repeated. Make sure your solution can handle ties.


Functions
Write a function that takes a string `substring` as an argument and returns an array of all of the words that contain that substring (the substring can appear anywhere in the word).

Write a function that takes a string `prefix` as an argument and returns an array of all of the words that start with that prefix (the prefix has to be at the beginning of the word).

Write a function that takes a string `prefix` as the first argument, a string `suffix` as the second argument, and an integer `length` as the third argument. It should return an array of all of the words that start with that prefix, end with that suffix, and are that length.

Write a function that takes a string `word` as an argument and returns a count of all of the “A”s in that string.

Write a function that takes a string `word` as the first argument, a string `letter` as the second argument, and returns a count of how many times `letter` occurs in `word`.

Write a function that takes a string `phrase` and returns a dictionary contains counts of how many times every character appears in `phrase`.
